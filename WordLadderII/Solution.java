Word Ladder II

Given two words (start and end), and a dictionary, find all shortest transformation sequence(s) from start to end, such that:

Only one letter can be changed at a time
Each intermediate word must exist in the dictionary
For example,

Given:
start = "hit"
end = "cog"
dict = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
Return
  [
    ["hit","hot","dot","dog","cog"],
    ["hit","hot","lot","log","cog"]
  ]
Note:
All words have the same length.
All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
